#Pseudo code:
#part 1
# Set up conditonals to have the user guess a number
# I want to let the user when their number is to big or too small
#Part 2
# Set up  conditionals that the user guess a number that is randomly generated.
# part 3
# I want it to do part 1 but be able to take a range of numbers from user.


# Part 1


#secret_num = 23

#user_guess = int(raw_input("Guess a number between 1 and 25: "))

#if user_guess > secret_num:
#	print "Your number is too big!"
#elif user_guess < secret_num:
#	print "your number is too small!"
#elif user_guess == secret_num:
#	print "Yay thats the number!"
#else: 
#	print "Something went wrong!"
